## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Throughout doing this challenge, I learnt how to structure my html markup as per the mobile design to make it easier to code, in addition to learning the css grid property ```order:1```.


### Continued development

I plan to continue using css grid where content on a webpage needs to be aligned on both the x and y axis in addition to exploring more css grid properties to become a bit more familiar



### Useful resources

- [MDN CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This is the guide to all the css properties with an indept explanation. Definitely recommend it.
